Hi i am Ata and i am 20 years old, i am currently studying public relations but my main interest is coding.

I am learning javascript&react because i want to gain some working experience through freelance webdevelopment but my main focus is python because
i want to pursue my career on Artificial Ä°ntelligence, and right now i am working on my math skills on my own for the future.
