Hello, I'm Ata, and I'm 20 years old. I'm currently studying public relations but my main interest is coding.

At the moment, I am learning Javascript & React because I want to gain work experience through freelancing web development. Though my main focus is Phython because I want to pursue an Artificial Intelligence career. Right now I'm working on my math skills for my own future.
